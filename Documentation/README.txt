Version 1.0

Synopsis:
			This Web Application is a Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) that is made to help Nurses Administer Insulin to patients. 


Motivation: 
			It is a project for our SER360 Software Engineering in Healthcare course at Quinnipiac University. 


Installation:
			The user must download the .zip of the application from the github page 'janinerjay' under the title SER360. This .zip should contain the html files for each screen and the css files, images and documentation should also be available. Once the .zip of the project is downloaded then the user will be able to click on the SignIn.html to get started with the application.

Future:
			At the moment this application is not backed by any database of patients or information, it is merely a prototype for a type of CDS that can be used in the medical industry. The next step for this application would be to make it fully functional with a complete back-end and then make it available online for hospitals and clinicians to use.
