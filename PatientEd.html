        <p>You are receiving this insulin because you have been diagnosed with diabetes. Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood to your cells. When your pancreas cannot naturally produce enough insulin to do that, it needs to be physically injected so that the glucose doesn’t build up in your blood. In addition to this you will need to make lifestyle/diet changes and need to keep your sugar levels within a certain range. If you don’t keep up with this it can lead to a worsening condition.</p>
